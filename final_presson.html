					<h3>Social Vulnerability</h3>
					<p>Socioeconomic status. Housing type. Transportation options. Beyond general demographics, these and other factors contribute to a population’s social vulnerability, <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html" target="_blank"> defined</a> by the Centers for Disease Control as “the potential negative effects on communities caused by external stresses on human health” like large-scale disease outbreaks or natural disasters.</p>
					<p>The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), developed and operated as a joint project between the CDC and Prevention and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, assigns vulnerability levels to each county in the United States based on demographics and data from the U.S. Census. The index was designed to help identify the amount of support needed by various communities and populations in order to get through and recover from events like outbreaks or disasters.</p>
					<p>As the global community prepares to enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts and scholars have worked to understand the impact of the pandemic on various inequalities around the world. They’ve found that largely, inequality – particularly <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/06/inequality-and-covid-19-ferreira.htm" target="_blank"> economic</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/16/coronavirus-pandemic-race-black-inequality-economics-429887" target="_blank"> social inequality</a> – has gotten worse over the course of the virus’ spread.</p>
					<p>“If a lot of individuals take steps towards safety, the whole community improves right?” Dr. David Reif told <a href="https://abc11.com/pandemic-vulnerability-index-covid-vaccine-nc-rates-north-carolina-dr-david-reif/10821276/" target="_blank"> ABC 11</a>. “And that's really what we're going for is that idea of vulnerability is about where you are and who your neighbors are and how your communities work."</p>

					<h3>The Pandemic Index</h3>
					<p>Alongside the SVI, Rief’s team at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences developed the Pandemic Vulnerability Index. Throughout the course of the pandemic, Rief’s team periodically updated the model to account for new and rising factors, such as vaccination rates.</p>
					<p>The current PVI model accounts for infection rates, population factors, intervention measures and health and environmental factors like hospital beds or comorbidities. Some of the data used in the model, like socioeconomic status and age distribution, are pulled from the SVI. The goal behind the PVI, and the periodic updates to the model, was to understand how various factors would impact response and recovery during the pandemic.</p>
					<p>"There are a lot of social justice, environmental justice, health disparity issues that go into vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy...there are lots of things that go into that, and the new model reflects that," Reif told ABC 11.</p>

					<h3>Economic Inequity</h3>
					<p>When businesses first began shutting their doors to in-person business at the start of the pandemic, many workers deemed “non-essential” were let go, and “essential” workers were asked to risk their health by continuing to work despite the COVID-19 exposure risks. The employment changes exacerbated existing financial and employment-based inequality.</p>
					<p>While white-collar workers were able to work remotely with a lesser degree of work-related COVID-19 exposure, the jobs typically filled by blue-collar workers either became limited due to the lack of in-person interactions and the overall shutdown from the pandemic.</p>
					<p>“And folks who are hourly employees, lower-wage jobs, service jobs are suffering,” Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, told <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/542548-how-the-pandemic-turbocharged-inequality?rl=1" target="_blank"> The Hill</a>. “It just exacerbated the underlying inequities in the economy, so it requires us to have much greater attention to the fault lines that were exposed by the pandemic.”</p>

					<h3>Racial Inequity</h3>
					<p>Beyond exacerbating economic inequality, the pandemic also worsened racial inequities in the United States. Racial wealth gaps became worsened, and Black and Latino workers were identified by University of Chicago economist Damon Jones to be more likely to hold “essential” jobs that placed them at a higher risk level for COVID-19 exposures.</p>
					<p>“It is kind of a feedback loop where the existing gaps are interacting with this pandemic and disproportionately affect people of certain racial groups, particularly Black and Latinx households,” Damon Jones, a University of Chicago economist, told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/16/coronavirus-pandemic-race-black-inequality-economics-429887" target="_blank"> Politico</a>. “And then coming out of it, the pandemic is probably leaving them worse off, relative to white households, than when it began.”</p>

					<h3>Vaccine Inequity</h3>
					<p>As inequities were worsened during the pandemic, many public health experts were working to develop prevention and recovery plans that would equally protect populations. A significant number of these plans revolved around expanding access to the vaccine during the earlier part of 2021 in order to further national and community vaccinations.</p>
					<p>Even now, months after vaccines became more widely available, vaccination rates and booster shots factor into the PVI. But earlier in the year, vaccination rates varied widely depending on demographic criteria like race and age – young people had lower vaccination rates over the summer due to the misconception that they would recover more easily.</p>
					<p>In the early days of the vaccine rollout, vaccination rates were highly dependent on occupation and the location of the vaccine clinics. This system of administering vaccines created vaccination clusters, and vaccination rates only evened out as clinics and the vaccines themselves became more widespread and available.</p>
					<p>“In public health, we start with data,” Megan Ranney, emergency department physician and associate dean of public health at Brown University and emergency department doctor, told <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/as-u-s-states-and-cities-hit-vaccine-goals-deep-disparities-persist" target="_blank"> PBS NewsHour</a>. “And when we drill down on who, exactly, has not yet received a vaccine, then we can start identifying — and fixing — both structural and informational barriers to vaccination.”</p>
